# Performance Improvement Report

This report summarizes the performance optimizations that have been implemented in the application. The goal of these optimizations was to improve the overall performance and user experience of the application without changing any existing functionality.

## Summary of Changes

The following optimizations were implemented:

### Backend

*   **Database Connection Pooling:** The backend was refactored to use a database connection pool (`mssql.ConnectionPool`). This is a critical optimization that will significantly reduce the overhead of creating new database connections for every API request, leading to a substantial improvement in API response times.
*   **Async/Await Refactoring:** All asynchronous database operations in `routes/index.js` were refactored from using nested callbacks to using `async/await`. This makes the code more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors.
*   **Parameterized Queries:** All SQL queries were converted to use parameterized statements. This is a crucial security enhancement to prevent SQL injection attacks, and it also allows the database to cache query plans, which can improve query performance.
*   **Consolidated API Endpoint:** A new API endpoint, `/index/getDashboardInitData`, was created to consolidate multiple individual API calls into a single request. This will significantly reduce the number of network round-trips required to load the dashboard, resulting in a faster initial page load.

### Frontend

*   **Consolidated API Calls:** The frontend JavaScript in `public/js/indexChairmanDaily.js` was refactored to use the new `/getDashboardInitData` endpoint. This replaces numerous individual AJAX calls with a single call, dramatically reducing network latency.
*   **Local Asset Loading:** All external CSS and JavaScript libraries are now served locally from the `public/vendor` directory. This eliminates the need for DNS lookups to external CDNs and reduces the application's dependency on third-party services, improving load times and reliability.
*   **UI Enhancements:** A loading spinner has been added to the application. It is displayed while the initial data is being fetched, providing better feedback to the user and improving the perceived performance of the application.

## Expected Performance Gains

The implemented changes are expected to result in the following performance improvements:

*   **Faster API Response Times:** The use of a database connection pool and optimized queries will significantly reduce the time it takes for the backend to respond to API requests.
*   **Faster Initial Page Load:** The consolidation of API calls and local serving of assets will dramatically reduce the time it takes for the dashboard to load for the first time.
*   **Improved User Experience:** The addition of a loading spinner and the overall performance improvements will lead to a smoother and more responsive user experience.
*   **Enhanced Security:** The use of parameterized queries eliminates the risk of SQL injection attacks, making the application more secure.

## Commands Used

The following commands were used to implement the optimizations:

*   `mkdir -p public/vendor/css && mkdir -p public/vendor/js && mkdir -p public/vendor/webfonts`: Created directories to store local copies of third-party libraries.
*   `curl`: Used to download all external CSS, JavaScript, and font files.
*   `replace_with_git_merge_diff` and `overwrite_file_with_block`: Used to refactor the backend and frontend code.
